Version Control with Git and GitHub
==========

An introduction to version control for novices using Git and GitHub. Forked from the original [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) course at <https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice>, to add in specific details for running the course at Durham University.

Please see <https://durhamarc.github.io/git-novice/> for a rendered version of this material,
or run `make` in this directory for a list of helpful commands.

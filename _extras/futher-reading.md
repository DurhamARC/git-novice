Please find a list of resources for further reading below. If you're looking for any other resources, please use the contact link below to get in touch.

 * **[Official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)**: includes tutorials as well as the full reference manual.
 * **[GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)**: a list of guides on GitHub, which include details of forking and pull requests - I recommend this way of working if you're using GitHub collaboratively. (Note that some of these resources are specific to GitHub rather than git in general.)
 * **[List of GUI git clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)**: a comprehensive list of git clients you could try. GitHub Desktop may be a good starting point as it is easy to use, but may not cover all your use cases. There is also a simple git GUI client included in the Windows git installation. If you need something more sophisticated then just try out some clients to see which suits you best.
 * **[Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)**: a browser-based git tutorial with visualisations.

Thank you for attending the course today. We'd love to hear your feedback so I'll be sharing a link to the feedback form in the chat.

The Teams channel will remain open so you can ask further questions in there.

For more information on GUI git clients and other guides, take a look at the [Further Reading](../further-reading/index.html) page.

There are also some further episodes you may wish to read, linked from the [home page](../).

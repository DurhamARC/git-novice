Despite this being an online course we want it to be as interactive as possible, so please follow along and be ready to let us know whether you're ready to move on, and if you need help.

For some of today you'll be working with a partner or in a group, using breakout rooms. I'm going to allocate the groups now. Please can you make a note of who you'll be working with and their GitHub username(s), which you'll need shortly.


We will have a break at around 10.20 and 11.20.

 * The course site contains full details of the course; I suggest you have it open alongside your git terminal/console. Please read the introduction on the home page while you’re waiting.
 * Please follow along with the commands as I demonstrate; there’ll be time at the end of each section to make sure you’ve completed it.
 * Please turn video on if possible (we’d love to see your children and pets!) but mute your microphone unless you need to ask a question.
 * Feel free to chat or ask questions in the meeting chat.

### Getting Help

 * Ask a question in the meeting chat if you need help.
 * A helper will respond, and open a private chat with you to try to help you solve your problem.
 * If you need to talk or share your screen, you will be put into a breakout room with a helper. When you have resolved your issue, click **Leave breakout room** to return to the main room. (Make sure you don’t choose to leave the meeting completely!)
 * If you've been in a breakout room to get help you may be assigned to a “lobby” breakout room later on – please choose to join later if you receive a message about this, as the lobby is just a placeholder room.
